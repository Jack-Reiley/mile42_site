/* Ported from the Dewey comp. Copy is verbatim; the structure is the site's
   own components. The comp draws this as a child of "What we do" with a
   breadcrumb — it is a top-level page instead, so it opens the way /why-mile42
   and /insights do, with an eyebrow and a hero H1 on its own identity band.

   `blue` is that identity band, the way `navy` is What We Do's, `gold` is How
   We Work's and `forest` is Why Mile42's. */

  {
    title: 'Organized by design',
    benefit: 'Knowledge lands in a place, not a pile. Tenants isolate customers or business units, namespaces separate domains, and directories and tags organize within them. The card catalog rolls it all up so agents and admins can see what’s known at a glance.',
    proof: [
      'Multi-tenant with per-tenant namespaces, created explicitly so nothing lands by accident',
      'Full filesystem semantics: directories, move and rename, metadata sidecars, tags, file links',
      'Card catalog rollups at the namespace, tenant, and platform level',
    ],
  },
  {
    title: 'Indexing is automatic',
    benefit: 'Upload is the whole pipeline. Put a file in and Dewey extracts the text, chunks it, and embeds it. No separate vector database to run, no sync jobs to babysit, no drift between what’s stored and what’s searchable.',
    proof: [
      'Single call to upload, with folder paths auto-created to any depth',
      'Async indexing with a status endpoint, so agents know exactly when content becomes searchable',
      'Replace a file in place and the index follows',
    ],
  },
  {
    title: 'Retrieval in every shape',
    benefit: 'Meaning and precision are different problems. Dewey gives agents both, plus answers. Semantic search finds concepts. Hybrid search adds an exact-term leg for part numbers and error codes. Ask returns a synthesized answer with cited sources.',
    proof: [
      'Semantic, hybrid, ask, and similarity endpoints, plus bounded grep and structured find',
      'Hybrid results report which leg found each hit, so relevance is explainable',
      'Batch retrieval pulls full content for many files in one call, across namespaces',
    ],
  },
  {
    title: 'Built for agents, approachable to humans',
    benefit: 'Point an agent at Dewey and it can learn the system on its own. The API serves a task-oriented agent guide with real captured examples. Humans get a wiki-style admin console over the same data, with search and cited answers built in.',
    proof: [
      'Self-serve agent guide served by the API itself, with worked scenarios from a live stack',
      'Error responses carry stable machine-readable codes so agents can branch, fix, and retry',
      'Admin console plus operations: stats, dedup, reindexing, and scheduled maintenance jobs',
    ],
  },
  {
    title: 'Agents never touch the system of record',
    benefit: 'Payroll, orders, HR, finance: these systems were never designed to be probed by autonomous software. Dewey is the buffer. Curated extracts land in Dewey, and agents work against the copy. The blast radius of a misbehaving agent is a read-only knowledge layer, not your ERP.',
    proof: [
      'No SOR credentials in agent context windows, prompts, or logs',
      'Least privilege by construction: scoped by tenant, namespace, and tags',
      'Retrieval load lands on Dewey, not on production transactional systems',
    ],
  },
  {
    title: 'One source of truth, every agent',
    benefit: 'Multi-agent systems drift when each agent carries its own context. Dewey centralizes knowledge and memory so every agent, and every human, reads from the same catalog. Update a document once and every consumer sees the change.',
    proof: [
      'One platform serving orchestrators, sub-agents, and humans from the same store',
      'Exactly one current version of every file, findable by all',
      'The card catalog is the shared map of what is known',
    ],
  },
  {
    title: 'Connected in both directions, deterministically',
    benefit: 'Data moves between Dewey and your systems of record through connectors built from plain, deterministic code. No LLM sits in the sync path, so there is no inference cost per run, no drift, and no surprises: the same input shapes the same way every time. Outbound updates can be gated by human review before they touch a source system.',
    proof: [
      'Inbound connectors with transformation and validation built in, so data arrives shaped and classified',
      'Configurable synchronization schedules per connector',
